        "body": "Mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children, who may or may not be their biological offspring. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth, by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilization, or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the third a surrogacy mother.",

        "body": "Love is a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes that ranges from interpersonal affection (\"I love my mother\") to pleasure (\"I loved that meal\"). It can refer to an emotion of a strong attraction and personal attachment.[1] It can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection\u2014\"the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another\".[2] It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.[3]\r\n\r\nNon-Western traditions have also distinguished variants or symbioses of these states.[4] This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.",

This is a week long festival where Goddess Gangamma(Grama Devatha) is worshiped.[26] Sri Krishna janmastami also known as Gokulashtami is celebrated with great fervor at Tirupati.
